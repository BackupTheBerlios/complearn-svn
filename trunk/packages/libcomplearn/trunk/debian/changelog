libcomplearn (0.9.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release; fixes broken compressor-listing as well as
    broken command-line option logic and broken binary matrix format in
    Windows.  Also rewrote CompAdaptor, now known as CompressionBase and
    CompressionBaseAdaptor.  Made a new better dynamic shared object module
    interface, and new parameter setting command line option -P.
  * Changed a few library symbol names to make them more consistent.
  * Added several new compressors including bzip2x, ppmdx, and lzmax.
  * Fixed broken maketree -T option to read text-format distance matrix.
  * Updated configure.ac to check for new nanohttp lib function.
    This packaging bug was preventing Google (ncd -g) search from working.
  * Many small packaging fixes, including renaming -dev packages
    without numerals, soname, modules, config files, lintian warnings, etc.
  * This package was downloaded from http://complearn.org/
  * Initial release of libcomplearn.  (Closes: #379087)

Quick Install
------------------

CompLearn requires the Gnu Scientific Libary, GSL, to be installed before
attempting to build.  You may use the command
gsl-config --libs
to check this if you like; if it prints something with -L and -l, it means
GSL is installed.  If you would rather let the complearn system check, you
will be notified when you attempt to configure as the first step in the
following build and install sequence.
You will also need to have the complearn library and header files installed
as well as an MPI environment such as mpich.

./configure
make
make install

If you do not have root access, you may need to do something like this:

./configure --prefix=$HOME/complearn
make
make install

Data Mining for the Slashdot Generation

A long time ago, we reported on Slashdot the results of new scientific
research involving data compression programs.  Scientists had been
experimenting with language analysis, spam detection, genetic analysis,
and much more.  Now, the software used to do the machine learning
experimnts and pattern recognition has been refined to version 0.9.6 and is
very near its 1.0 release.  The CompLearn development team would like to take
this opportunity to welcome the Slashdot community to have a look at the
libcomplearn software library and see if it suits your expanding needs
as software developers.  Does it allow you to quickly solve the
data mining and pattern recognition applications that interest you?
As we get ready to release 1.0 we are particularly in need of API feedback.
If you have ever been interested in artificial intelligence,
statistics without calculus, or foundational math, then please enjoy
our software library offering and research.  I have taken great pains to
make the software as easy to install as possible; if you are
familiar with programs like bzip2 or gzip then you can already combine
data compression programs with Neural Networks or Support Vector Machines
to create powerful recognition systems.

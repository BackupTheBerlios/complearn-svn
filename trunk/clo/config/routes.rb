ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
  # Add your own custom routes here.
  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
  
  # Here's a sample route:
  # map.connect 'products/:id', :controller => 'catalog', :action => 'view'
  # Keep in mind you can assign values other than :controller and :action

  # You can have the root of your site routed by hooking up '' 
  # -- just remember to delete public/index.html.
  # map.connect '', :controller => "clo", :action => "fun"
  map.connect 'index.html', :controller => 'clo', :action => 'fun'
  map.connect '', :controller => 'clo', :action => 'fun'
  map.connect 'fun.html', :controller => 'clo', :action => 'fun'
  map.connect 'listmonths.html', :controller => 'clo', :action => 'listmonths'
  map.connect 'clo/showmonth/:id/experiments.html', :controller => 'clo',
                                                    :action => 'showmonth'
  map.connect 'clo/showexpnum/:id/experiments.html', :controller => 'clo',
                                                     :action => 'showexpnum'

  # instead of a file named 'wsdl'
  map.connect ':controller/service.wsdl', :action => 'wsdl'

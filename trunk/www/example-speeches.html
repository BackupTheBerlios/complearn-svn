<h1>CompLearn Example: A Study in Rhetoric</h1>

<p>The following example examines some of the most noteworthy public addresses
made by American political figures.  The text of these speeches are also
included with the software.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Create a Distance Matrix</h3>

<pre>$ ncd -b -d examples/speeches examples/speeches</pre>

<p>This creates a <strong>square distance matrix</strong> using the
speech texts in the <strong>examples/speeches</strong> directory of the
CompLearn distribution.  With the <strong>-b</strong> option, a binary file
called <strong>distmatrix.clb</strong> will be created by default. The results
of this command are also <a href="speeches-dm.txt" target="_blank">output to
stdout.</a></p>

<h3>Step 2: Generate a Tree</h3>
<pre>$ maketree distmatrix.clb</pre>
<p>Here, we use the previously created distance matrix to create an
<strong>unrooted binary tree</strong>.  The resulting tree is output as a
<strong>.dot</strong> file called <strong>treefile.dot</strong> by default.
The <a href="speeches-unrooted-dot.txt" target="_blank">contents of the
resulting .dot file</a> describe how the nodes of the tree are connected and
how they are labeled. <strong>Please note</strong>: because we are generating a
tree from a 18x18 matrix, <strong>maketree</strong> may take several minutes
to complete.  However, feel free to take a peek at
<strong>treefile.dot</strong> while it is still in progress.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Lay Out Your Tree</h3>
<pre>$ neato -Tps -Gsize=7,7 treefile.dot > speeches-unrooted.ps</pre>

<p>This <strong>neato</strong> command will create a visual representation of
your tree in postscript format.  This particular <a
href="images/speeches-unrooted.ps">postscript file</a> is laid out
on a 7x7 inch drawing area.</p>

<p>If instead you prefer a <a
href="images/speeches-unrooted.png" target="_blank">browser-compatible
format</a>, such as <strong>.png</strong> you can use the following command.

<pre>$ neato -Tpng treefile.dot > speeches-unrooted.png</pre>

<p><strong>neato</strong> supports other popular formats such as
<strong>.jpg</strong> and <strong>.gif</strong>.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Analyze Your Results</h3>
<p>The results may be surprising to some, as one would expect the
<strong>deliverers</strong> of these famous addresses to cluster together.
Rather, <strong>context</strong> appears to be the underlying factor in this
small example.  As you can see, speeches which refer to great tragedies in
American history occupy their own branch, John F. Kennedy's civil rights
address is quite close to Martin Luther King, Jr's own civil rights speech,
and texts that call for action, such as Reagan's 1st Inaugural, JFK's Cuban
Missile Crisis address, and Malcom X's "Ballot or Bullet" speech cluster
together as well.</p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<img src="images/questionmark.gif" align="right">
<h3>1. What is CompLearn?</h3>
<p>CompLearn is a software system built to support compression-based learning
in a wide variety of applications.  It provides this support in the form of a
library written in highly portable ANSI C that runs in most modern computer
environments with minimal confusion.  It also supplies a small suite of simple,
composable command-line utilities as simple applications that use this library.
Together with other commonly used machine-learning tools such as LibSVM and
GraphViz, CompLearn forms an attractive offering in machine-learning frameworks
and toolkits.  It is designed to be extensible in a variety of ways including
modular dynamic-linking plugins (like those used in the Apache webserver) and a
language-neutral SOAP interface to supply instant access to core functionality
in every major language.</p>

<h3>2. Why did the version numbers skip so far between 0.6.4 and 0.8.12?</h3>
<p>In early 2005 a major rewrite occurred.  This was due to poor organization
of the original complearn package, leading to compilation and installation
difficulties in far too many situations.  This issue was addressed by using a
complete rewrite from the ground up of all functionality; earlier versions
used a combination of C and Ruby to deliver tree searching.  The new version
delivers all core functionality, such as NCD and tree searching, in a pure
C library.  On top of this library is layered a variety of other interfaces
such as SOAP and a new in-process direct-extension CompLearn Ruby binding layer.
But all dependencies have been reworked and are now modularized so that
Ruby and almost every other software package is now optional and a variety
of different configurations will compile cleanly.</p>

<p>Another major enhancement in the new complearn is the addition of a
Google compressor to calculate NGD.  This has opened up whole new areas of
Quantitative Subjective Analysis (QSA) to complement our existing more
classically pure statistical methods in earlier gzip-style NCD research.
By querying the Google webserver through a SOAP layer we may convert page
counts of search terms to virtual file lengths that can be used to determine
semantic relationships between terms.  Please see the paper
Automatic Meaning Discovery Using Google for more information.</p>

<h3>3. I can't get the Google compressor to work.  When I type ncd -L, it's not
even listed as one of the builtin compressors.  What am I doing wrong?</h3>

<p>You may not have the <strong>csoap</strong> library installed, which is
necessary for the Google compressor to work. You can check this
when you run your <strong>./configure</strong> command during the
<strong>CompLearn</strong> installation phase.  A "NO" in the
<strong>CompLearn</strong> dependency table for <strong>csoap</strong>
indicates you need to install the <strong>csoap</strong> library.</p>

<p>You can download <strong>csoap</strong> at the following link:</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=74977"
target="_blank">
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=74977</a></p>

<p>Once <strong>csoap</strong> is installed, you will need to run the
<strong>./configure</strong> command again (for CompLearn), perhaps with a
"--with-csoap" option depending on the location of the <strong>csoap</strong>
installation.  For more options, you can type</p>

<pre>./configure --help</pre>

<p>Please see our <a href="download.html">Dependencies section</a> for more
information on <strong>CompLearn</strong> library dependencies.</p>

<h3>4. The Windows demo isn't working for me?  Why not?</h3>

<p>If you have <a href="http://cygwin.com/" target="_blank">cygwin</a>
installed on your computer, it's very likely you need to update it.  The
<strong>CompLearn</strong> Windows demo uses version 1.5.17 of the cygwin dll;
any previous versions are not compatible with the demo.  To update your cygwin,
go to <a href="http://cygwin.com/" target="_blank">http://cygwin.com</a> and
hit the <strong>Install or Update now link.</strong></p>

<p>You may also need to download and install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/default.aspx" target="_blank"> DirectX</a>.</p>

<h3>5. gsl and CompLearn seemed to install perfectly, but ncd can't load the
gsl library.</h3>

<p>Users may get the following message if this happens:</p>

<pre>ncd: error while loading shared libraries: libgslcblas.so.0: cannot
open shared object file: No such file or directory</pre>

<p>If this is the case, your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable may need to
be set.  For example, you can try the following before running the
<strong>ncd</strong> command:</p>

<pre>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib</pre>

<h3>6. How can this demo work with only 1000 queries a day?</h3>

<p>There are two reasons this demo is able to do as much as it does.  One is
that Google has generously (and free of charge to me) upgraded my Google API
account key daily search limit.  You might email them to ask yourself if you
have an interesting Google API based search application of your own.  The
other reason the demo works is because there is a cache of recent page result
counts.  You can see this cache by looking in the $HOME/.complearn directory.
Sometimes larger experiments must be run over the course of two days.
</p>

<h3>7. How come the counts returned from (any particular) Google API are
different that the numbers I see when I enter searches by hand?</h3>

<p>I have two possible explanations for this behavior.  One is that it would
be prohibitively expensive to count the exact total of all pages indexed
for most common search terms.  Instead they use an estimation heuristic called
"prefixing" whereby they just use a short sample of webpages as a
representative set for the web and scale up as appropriate.  I presume this
and also that when you do a search (either by hand or from the API) you can
get connected to any one of a number of different search servers, each with
a slightly different database.  In a rapidly changing large global network
it is unlikely that there will be an exact match for the counts on any
particular common term because each server must maintain its own distinct
"aging snapshot" of the internet.</p>

<h3>8. When I compile csoap, I don't seem to be getting shared libraries.
Or even though csoap is installed, complearn doesn't seem to be detecting
the shared library.</h3>

<p>Try compiling csoap from source with the following options:
<pre>
   --with-libxml-prefix=/usr --enable-shared --with-pic
</pre>

Then try reconfiguring and recompiling complearn.

<p>Thanks to Tsu Do Nimh for this tip.</p>

<h3>9. Is it important to adjust or choose a compressor?  How should I do it?</h3>

<p>Yes, it is very important to choose a good compressor for your application.
The "blocksort" compressor is the current default.  It is a virtual compressor
using a simple blocksorting algorithm.  It will give results something like
frequency analysis, spectral analysis, and substring matching combined.  It
works very well for small strings (or files) of 100 bytes or less.  If you have
more than about 100 bytes then it is probably better to use one of the other
three favorite compressors other than the default:

<pre>
ncd -C zlib
</pre>

will get you "zlib" style compression which is like gzip and is limitted to
files of up to 15K in size.

<pre>
ncd -C bzip
</pre>
will get you "bzip2" style compression which is like zlib but allows for files
up to about 450K in size.

The best accuracy is available using the "real compressor" shell option.
For this to work you need to use a script like this:

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
cd /tmp
cat &gt;infile
/ufs/cilibrar/bin/ppmd e infile &gt;/dev/null &lt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null
cat infile.pmd
rm infile infile.pmd
</pre>

<B>Note: if you are analyzing DNA, you should add two <i>very</i> important
options to ppmd in order to get the best results like this:</b>
<pre>
/ufs/cilibrar/bin/ppmd e -o15 -m255 infile &gt;/dev/null &lt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null
</pre>
This means "use 15th order instead of the default 4th order" and "use 255 megs of memory instead of the default of 10".  If you don't do this, you will have terrible results because the ppmd will be restricted to a very narrow range of contexts.


If you install that script in <b>$HOME/bin/catppmd</b> and don't forget to
chmod it executable (using <b> chmod a+rx $HOME/bin/catppmd </b> for instance)
then you can use it with the following option to ncd:

<pre>
ncd -r $HOME/bin/catppmd
</pre>

<h3>10. Running ./configure gives me the following error: cannot find input file: src/complearn/aclconfig.h.in. Where can I find this file?</h3>

<p>You will need to generate this header input file by running the autoheader
command.  autoheader is packaged with autoconf.

<pre>
autoheader
</pre>

<h3>11. I get the configure error: Can't locate object method "path" via
package "Request" at /usr/share/autoconf/Autom4te/C4che.pm line 69, <GEN1> line
111.  make[1]: *** [configure] Error 1. Is there an easy way to fix this?</h3>

<p>In the top directory of the CompLearn distribution, run the following
commands:</p>

<pre>
rm -rf autom4te.cache
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>
make maintainer-clean
</pre>

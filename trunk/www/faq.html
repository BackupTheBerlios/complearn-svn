<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<img src="images/questionmark.gif" align="right">
<h3>1. What is CompLearn?</h3>
<p>CompLearn is a software system built to support compression-based learning
in a wide variety of applications.  It provides this support in the form of a
library written in highly portable ANSI C that runs in most modern computer
environments with minimal confusion.  It also supplies a small suite of simple,
composable command-line utilities as simple applications that use this library.
Together with other commonly used machine-learning tools such as LibSVM and
GraphViz, CompLearn forms an attractive offering in machine-learning frameworks
and toolkits.  It is designed to be extensible in a variety of ways including
modular dynamic-linking plugins (like those used in the Apache webserver) and a
language-neutral SOAP interface to supply instant access to core functionality
in every major language.</p>

<h3>2. Why did the version numbers skip so far between 0.6.4 and 0.8.12?</h3>
<p>In early 2005 a major rewrite occurred.  This was due to poor organization
of the original complearn package, leading to compilation and installation
difficulties in far too many situations.  This issue was addressed by using a
complete rewrite from the ground up of all functionality; earlier versions
used a combination of C and Ruby to deliver tree searching.  The new version
delivers all core functionality, such as NCD and tree searching, in a pure
C library.  On top of this library is layered a variety of other interfaces
such as SOAP and a new in-process direct-extension CompLearn Ruby binding layer.
But all dependencies have been reworked and are now modularized so that
Ruby and almost every other software package is now optional and a variety
of different configurations will compile cleanly.</p>

<p>Another major enhancement in the new complearn is the addition of a
Google compressor to calculate NGD.  This has opened up whole new areas of
Quantitative Subjective Analysis (QSA) to complement our existing more
classically pure statistical methods in earlier gzip-style NCD research.
By querying the Google webserver through a SOAP layer we may convert page
counts of search terms to virtual file lengths that can be used to determine
semantic relationships between terms.  Please see the paper
Automatic Meaning Discovery Using Google for more information.</p>

<h3>3. I can't get the Google compressor to work.  When I type ncd -L, it's not
even listed as one of the builtin compressors.  What am I doing wrong?</h3>

<p>You may not have the <strong>csoap</strong> library installed, which is
necessary for the Google compressor to work. You can check this
when you run your <strong>./configure</strong> command during the
<strong>CompLearn</strong> installation phase.  A "NO" in the
<strong>CompLearn</strong> dependency table for <strong>csoap</strong>
indicates you need to install the <strong>csoap</strong> library.</p>

<p>You can download <strong>csoap</strong> at the following link:</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=74977"
target="_blank">
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=74977</a></p>

<p>Once <strong>csoap</strong> is installed, you will need to run the
<strong>./configure</strong> command again (for CompLearn), perhaps with a
"--with-csoap" option depending on the location of the <strong>csoap</strong>
installation.  For more options, you can type</p>

<pre>./configure --help</pre>

<p>Please see our <a href="download.html">Dependencies section</a> for more
information on <strong>CompLearn</strong> library dependencies.</p>

<h3>4. The Windows demo isn't working for me?  Why not?</h3>

<p>If you have <a href="http://cygwin.com/" target="_blank">cygwin</a>
installed on your computer, it's very likely you need to update it.  The
<strong>CompLearn</strong> Windows demo uses version 1.5.17 of the cygwin dll;
any previous versions are not compatible with the demo.  To update your cygwin,
go to <a href="http://cygwin.com/" target="_blank">http://cygwin.com</a> and
hit the <strong>Install or Update now link.</strong></p>

<p>You may also need to download and install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/default.aspx" target="_blank"> DirectX</a>.</p>
